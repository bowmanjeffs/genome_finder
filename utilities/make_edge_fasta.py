CALL AS:
    make_edge_fasta.py -csv [unique.csv] -start [start-inclusive] -stop [stop-not inclusive]
    
This script makes a fasta file of the reads associated with a given range of edges.  If you
would like the reads associated within only one edge (such as 1234), you would use edge edge+1
as the arguments (1234 1235).

The input csv file should be the unique csv file produced by paprica (called in that paprica_place_it script).
It probably has a name that follows the form [yoursample].[domain].unique_seqs.csv.
